# FAAA 💥

Plays a **FAAA** sound whenever any terminal command fails (non-zero exit code).

Because you deserve to hear it.

## Requirements
- VS Code 1.93+
- Shell Integration must be enabled (it is by default)

## How it works
Any command in the VS Code terminal that exits with a non-zero code → FAAA.
